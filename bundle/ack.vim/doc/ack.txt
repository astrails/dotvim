INTRODUCTION                                                             *ack*

This plugin is a front for the Perl module App::Ack.  Ack can be used as a
replacement for grep.  This plugin will allow you to run ack from vim, and
shows the results in a split window.

:Ack [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                                  *:Ack*

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for the {pattern}.  Behaves just like the |:grep| command, but
    will open the |Quickfix| window for you.

:AckAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                            *:AckAdd*

    Just like |:Ack|, but instead of making a new list, the matches are
    appended to the current |quickfix| list.

:AckFromSearch [{directory}]                                  *:AckFromSearch*

    Just like |:Ack| but the pattern is from previous search.

:LAck [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                                *:LAck*

    Just like |:Ack| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are placed in
    the current |location-list|.

:LAckAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                          *:LAckAdd*

    Just like |:AckAdd| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are added
    to the current |location-list|

:AckFile [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                          *:AckFile*

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for filenames matching the {pattern}.  Behaves just like the
    |:grep| command, but will open the |Quickfix| window for you.

Files containing the search term will be listed in the split window, along
with the line number of the occurrence, once for each occurrence.  <Enter> on
a line in this window will open the file, and place the cursor on the matching
line.
