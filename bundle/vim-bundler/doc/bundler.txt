INTRODUCTION                                    *bundler*

This lightweight companion to rails.vim and rake.vim provides support for
Bundler.  In addition to the below commands, it also syntax highlights
Gemfile and Gemfile.lock, and alters 'path' and 'tags' to include bundled
gems.  I recommend gem-ctags for generating tags for your gems.

COMMANDS                                        *bundler-commands*

                                                *bundler-:Bundle*
:Bundle[!] [args]       Invoke `bundle` via |:make|.


                                                *bundler-:Bopen*
:Bopen[!] [gem]         With no argument, edits the Gemfile.  Otherwise,
                        effectively does a `bundle open` of a gem inside of
                        Vim, including an |:lcd| to the gem's root directory.
                        Add ! to discard the current buffer's changes.

                                                *bundler-:Bedit*
:Bedit[!] [gem]         Like |:Bopen|, but don't |:lcd| afterwards.
