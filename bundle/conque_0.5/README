Conque - Interactive shell buffer for Vim

author: nico raffo <nicoraffo@gmail.com>
modified: 2009-12-01
version: 0.5
info: http://code.google.com/p/conque/

== REQUIREMENTS ==

   * Python-enabled Vim 7.0+
   * Some functionality only available on Linux-like system with pty libraries

== INSTALLATION ==

Copy files from conque/ into your .vim directory, for example:

$HOME/.vim/plugin/conque.vim
$HOME/.vim/syntax/conque.vim
$HOME/.vim/autoload/conque.vim
$HOME/.vim/autoload/subprocess.vim
$HOME/.vim/autoload/subprocess/proc_py.vim
$HOME/.vim/autoload/subprocess/shell_translate.vim

== USAGE ==

Type :Conque <command> to run your command in vim, for example:

:Conque bash
:Conque mysql -h localhost -u joe -p sock_collection
:Conque ipython

To open Conque in a new horizontal or vertical buffer use:

:ConqueSplit <command>
:ConqueVSplit <command>

Use insert mode to send commands to the shell. Use the <Tab> key to get more output from the shell. Conque is set to a 40 milisecond timeout by default, so you will likely need to use the <Tab> key frequently.

== CONFIG OPTIONS ==

The following options can be added to your .vimrc file. (Defaults shown below)

" Return prompt to user after this many miliseconds without any new output from the terminal. 
" Increasing this value will cause fewer read timeouts, but will also make the terminal appear less responsive.
let g:Conque_Read_Timeout = 40

" Use this syntax type with Conque. The default is relatively stripped down, although it does provide good MySQL highlighting
let g:Conque_Syntax = 'conque'

" Terminal identification
" Leaving this value as "dumb" will cause the fewest formatting errors, and may make the terminal slightly faster. 
" Setting it to "xterm" will enable more features.
let g:Conque_TERM = 'dumb'

== KNOWN ISSUES ==

 * Most complex, full-screen applications will not work in Conque. You will not be able to launch programs such as alpine using Conque.
 * Conque does not continuously poll your program for new output. If you are expecting more output but nothing is happening, press <Tab> to get more.
 * Tab completion and history navigation may start to break down when your command is longer than the width of the screen. This will get fixed in a future version. Tab completion is generally squirrely in zsh for some reason, and it may require you to use TERM=xterm in (t)csh.
 * Some Ubuntu users have been able to load Conque on the terminal Vim, but not using graphical GVim. Two Ubuntu and one Kubuntu install later I haven't been able to reproduce this. If it happens to you, please send me an email with your :version output and operating system version.

== TROUBLESHOOTING ==

The most common problem will be not having Python enabled in your installation of Vim. Recent versions of Vim should come with Python enabled by default. To check for Python, run the ":version" command and check for "+python". If instead you see "-python" or "+python/dyn", it may mean you will need to install it.

 - Windows -

The default installation of GVim on Windows comes with "+python/dyn", which means python can be installed independently of Vim and loaded at runtime. Towards the bottom of the ":version" command in the "Compilation" section, look for a config option that looks something like -DDYNAMIC_PYTHON_DLL="python24.dll". This will let you know which version of python you need to install, in this case version 2.4. Go to http://www.python.org/ to download the version that your installation of Vim requires. NOTE: installing an earlier or newer version will probably not work.

 - Mac -

The latest version of MacVim will have Python enabled. See http://code.google.com/p/macvim/

 - Linux -

Most installations of Vim 7+ these days come built with Python.
