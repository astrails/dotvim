## Dotvim

### An attempt at The Ultimate Vim Configurationâ„¢ ;)

All the right plugins are in. Nerdtree, CtrlP, you name it.

The focus is on supporting Rails, but there is a lot of generic stuff too, so
it will surely serve you well with any language of your choice.

The config is using [Vundle](http://github.com/gmarik/vundle) for easy
upgrading.

*Some* help tips are provided for *some* of the plugins. please check out the
plugin's docs for more info.

Follow [@vkushner][@vkushner] and [@astrails][@astrails] on Twitter to receive
announcements of new versions, tips, etc.

<a name=installation>
##### Installation

From your homedirectory (on Linux/Mac OSX):

* `git clone git://github.com/astrails/dotvim.git`
* `ln -sfn dotvim .vim`
* `ln -sfn dotvim/vimrc .vimrc`
* `cd .vim; make install`


  > Note: if you already have `~/.vim` `~/.vimrc` REMOVE THEM (you might want to backup them first :)

* create `~/.vimrc.before` or `~/.vimrc.after` if you want to have some
  local/personal settings you don't want to commit into the repo. see "[Local Configuration](#local)"


  > IMPORTANT: **always** add a `colorscheme` to your `~/.vimrc.after` file.
  > Even if you use the defaults scheme add `colorscheme default`. Othewise you
  > will get a highlighting error `"E411: highlight group not found: Normal"`
  > during vim startup.


> IMPORTANT: [vim-powerline](#powerline) requires some extra glyphs to work properly.
> Check the official documentation on
> [font installation](http://lokaltog.github.com/powerline/overview.html#font-installation)
> and follow the instructions. If you do not, then strange symbols will be
> displayed instead. While this is not critical, it remains pretty annoying.

<a name=general>
#### General configuration

`,` is used as mapleader
`backslash` is used as localleader

* `,e` mapped to `:e **/`. essentially you do `,efoo<tab>` to get a list of all files starting with foo
* `,s` - toggle invisible characters display
* `,n` - next `quicklist` result (like :Ggrep etc)
* `,N` - previous `quicklist` result (like :Ggrep etc)
* `Ctrl-E` - switch between 2 last buffers  (its just a `:b#<cr>` :)
* `Ctrl-N` to cancel current search highlighing
* `,f` global Ggrep for word under the cursor or for selection
* `+`, `-` - easily inc/decrement integers
* `,W` - remove trailing spaces
* `Ctrl`-`h`/`j`/`k`/`l` - simplified split panes navigation
* `,d` - `:diffupdate`
* `,dp` - `:diffput`
* `,dg` - `:diffget`
* `%%` - in **control mode**, i.e. after you typed `:` it will expand to the
  directory name of the currently opened file.

Check out the 'plugins.vim' and 'after/plugin/bindings.vim' files for more...

<a name=local>
#### Local configuration

For easy upgrades its preferable not to change the dotvim configuration files.
Instead you can add your own local configuration into one of the local override
files. There are several override files supported by dotvim.

They are loaded in the following order:

* base dotvim configuration (global, plugin configurations, bindings, macros)
* `~/.local-before.vim` _[deprecated]_
* `~/.vimrc.before`

  Loaded **before** the plugins

  This is where you should pre-set various plugin flags, enable/disable options
  etc. This is for things you would normally put into your vimrc file.

* `~/.gvimrc.before` _[when GUI running]_
* vim plugins
* dotvim bindings and overrides (loaded from `~/.vim/after.vim`)
* `.local-after.vim` _[deprecated]_
* `.vimrc.after`

  Loaded **after** the plugins

  This is where you can override settings set by plugins that have no
  customization options.

* `.gvimrc.after` _[when GUI running]_

<a name=backups>
#### Backups

Backups and swapfiles are disabled. I really hate them both.

You can re-enable backups by adding the following to your `~/.local.vim`:

    set backup

 and swapfiles by

    set swapfile

backup dir is set to ~/.backup/

The directory is created if it doesn't exist.

[top](#top)

<a name=undo>
#### Persistent Undo

Persistent undos are enabled by default.

You can disable by adding the following to your `~/.local.vim`:

    set noundo

[top](#top)

<a name=macros>
#### Macros

I included a couple of macros that I frequently use in macros.vim which
is loaded from after.vim:

*    `@q` (re)format paragraph forward
*    `@s` enclose selection with double \*. e.g. \*\*foo\*\*.

You really should start writing your own macros. The life will never be the
same ;).

I recommend editing your macros in a vim buffer.

To load a macro into a register you can 'yank' it.

For example if you have a line with a macro and cursor is at the beginning of
it `"ay$`  will load the macro into register `a`, so that you will be able to
execute it with `@a`.

      * `:h NrrwRgn` - read the help ;)

*   <a name=utl.vim>[utl.vim](https://github.com/vim-scripts/utl.vim) ([top](#top))

    Universal Text Linking plugin allow to open urls from text files.

    `:h utl_usr` to read the help.

    Bindings:

    * `,o` - types `:Utl`. you still need to press enter to `o`pen url. This way
      it allows to type other commands if needed.

*   <a name=VimOrganizer>[VimOrganizer](https://github.com/hsitz/VimOrganizer) ([top](#top))

    VimOrganizer is partly a clone of Emacs' Org-mode, and partly a front end
    to Org-mode itself. Do Org in Vim.

    Some bindings:

    * `tab` - cycle visibility of single headline/subtree.
    * `,1` - show level 1 only
    * `,2` - show level 1 only
    * ...
    * In normal mode
      * `Shift-Enter` - cycle TODO state
      * `Enter` - add item of same level
    * insert mode
      * `Shift-Enter` - add item of same level
    * Both modes
      * `Ctrl-Enter` - add item of lover level
      * `Shift-Ctrl-Enter` - add item of higher level
    * `,dd` - add DEADLINE
    * `,ds` - add SCHEDULED
    * `,dc` - add CLOSED
    * `,dt` - add a timestamp

    Datetime prompt works mostly like the one in emacs org mode. See docs [here](http://orgmode.org/manual/The-date_002ftime-prompt.html#The-date_002ftime-prompt)

    Its too big to give much userful information here. open any `.org` file to start using it. read the help:

        :h VimOrganizer

    You can find cheat sheet [here](https://github.com/hsitz/VimOrganizer/blob/master/VimOrganizerCheatsheet.org)

<a name=russian>
#### Russian Translit Layout support

There is ~/.vim/bindings-ru-translit.vim file.

OSX has a nice russian translit keyboard layout which I use when I need to
write any russian text. The problem is that once I go to the normal mode
nothing works. This is an attempt to make vim at least partially useful when
the kerboard is in russioan translit mode and not in the default US mode. The
idea is to remap the russian characters to the english characters that
correspond to the same keyboard key. And a couple of userful multy-key
combinations.

Similar can be done for other keyboard layouts, your pull requests are
welcome ;).

To use this feature: just include the file from your ~/.local.vim:

    source ~/.vim/bindings-ru-translit.vim

<a name=writer>
#### writer.vim

My attempt to make vim look like iWriter ;)
You can read about the details on [our blog][blog_writer].

In short, just do `:so ~/.vim/writer.vim` when you are going to do some plain
text writing.
