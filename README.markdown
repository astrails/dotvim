This is a complete Vim configuration that I'm using everywhere

Plugins that are available from a git repository were added with
[Braid](http://github.com/evilchelu/braid) for easy upgrading.

*Some* help tips are provided for *some* of the plugins. please check out the plugin's docs for more info.

##### Installation

From your homedirectory (on Linux/Mac OSX):

* `git clone git://github.com/astrails/dotvim.git`
* `ln -sfn dotvim .vim`
* `ln -sfn dotvim/vimrc .vimrc`
* you create and edit ~/.vim\_local if you want to have your some
  local/personal settings you don't want to commit into the repo

* If you want to use command-t file finder plugin you need to compile native extension first.
  just run `make` at the top of .vim directory

Note: if you already have `~/.vim` `~/.vimrc` REMOVE THEM (you might want to backup them first :)

#### General configuration

`,` is used as mapleader
`backslash` is used as localleader

* `,e` mapped to `:e **/`. essentially you do `,efoo<tab>` to get a list of all files starting with foo
* `,s` - toggle invisible characters display
* `,n` - next `quicklist` result (like :Ggrep etc)
* `,N` - previous `quicklist` result (like :Ggrep etc)
* `Ctrl-E` - switch between 2 last buffers  (its just a `:b#<cr>` :)
* `Ctrl-N` to cancel current search highlighing
* `,f` global Ggrep for word under the cursor or for selection

Check out the 'vimrc' file for more...
